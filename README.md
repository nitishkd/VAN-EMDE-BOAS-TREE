# VAN-EMDE-BOAS-TREE
## Comparision of Van Emde Boas Tree with Binomial Heap and AVL Tree in context of Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree

### ACCEPTED SUBMISSIONS:

* BINOMIAL HEAP : https://www.hackerearth.com/submission/21781876/
* AVL TREE : https://www.hackerearth.com/submission/21779716/
* vEB Tree : https://www.hackerearth.com/submission/21778941/

### INPUT FORMAT:

### vEB Tree:
* To Compile: g++ vEB.cpp -o vEB
* To Execute: ./vEB
* Input Format:
```
  *  Line 1 contains two integer values N and M, where N is number of Nodes and M is  number of Edges.

  *  Next M lines, each containing 3 integers X, Y, W where there is an Edge between X and Y with weight W.
```

* Constraints:
```
  * 1 <= N  <= 100000
  * 1 <= M  <= 1000000
  * 0 <= X,Y <= N-1
  * 1 <= W  <= 65530
```

* NOTE: The graph should always be connected and should not result in a forest.

### AVL Tree:
* To Compile: g++ AVL.cpp -o AVL
* To Execute: ./AVL
* Input Format:
```
  *  Line 1 contains two integer values N and M, where N is number of Nodes and M is  number of Edges.

  *  Next M lines, each containing 3 integers X, Y, W where there is an Edge between X and Y with weight W.
```

* Constraints:
```
  * 1 <= N  <= 100000
  * 1 <= M  <= 1000000
  * 0 <= X,Y <= N-1
  * 1 <= W  <= 65530
```

* NOTE: The graph should always be connected and should not result in a forest.
